# Stroke Predicition Analysis:
In this project, we will discuss the risk factors for a stroke. Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Knowing your risk or knowing you are at risk is key to prevention. We all know someone that has been affected by a stroke and understand the impact a stroke can play long term. Prevention is key to long term success of preventing a stroke, the number one cause of most or all strokes are the comorbidities of Hypertension (High Blood Pressure). Controlling your high blood pressure by blood pressure medication is a great prevention. Glucose Level is another factor of stroke, uncontrolled blood sugar will start causing the blood vessels to slow production of blood flow which can cause a clot in the veins and they can travel. Smoking is another factor of a stroke; smokers are more likely to have a stroke than non-smokers. We also included the work type and age in the factors in this app. This predicition app will tell you if you are likely or not likely to have a stroke. 

# PREVENTION IS KEY!

# There are 3 types of Strokes:
* TIA (mini-strokes, warning strokes)
* Ischemic Strokes (clots)
* Hemorrhagic Strokes (bleed)
